            <strong>Middle notes</strong> are also called the <strong>"heart notes"</strong>, the middle notes are the scent of a perfume that emerges just before the top notes dissipate.

            The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time.
            Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood, rose and jasmine.
