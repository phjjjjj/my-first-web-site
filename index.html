            <strong>Perfume</strong> is <u>a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds (fragrances)</u>, fixatives and solvents, usually in liquid form, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent.

            Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, making the harmonious scent accord. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the <a href="top.html">top note</a> leading to the deeper <a href=middle.html">middle notes</a>, and the <a href=base.html">base notes</a> gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.
